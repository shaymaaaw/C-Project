Custom String Functions and Bit Counting in C --> 

Developed custom implementations of standard string functions in C, including strcmp, strncmp, and strchr, renamed as my_strcmp, my_strncmp, and my_strchr, to enhance understanding of string manipulation.
The my_strchr function was modified to return the index of a character in a string instead of a pointer, returning -1 if the character was not found.
Created a bits_count function to calculate the number of set bits in even positions of a long unsigned integer.
Ensured robustness and accuracy through extensive testing with various input scenarios.
This description highlights your understanding of string manipulation, bitwise operations, and your ability to implement and test C functions
